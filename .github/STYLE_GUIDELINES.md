## General Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in naming, formatting, and code organization throughout the project.
- **Readability**: Prioritize code readability. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and components.
- **Comments**: Use comments to explain complex logic, especially when it's not immediately obvious.
- **Modularity**: Keep functions and components focused on a single responsibility.
- **Linting**: Utilize linting tools to automatically enforce coding style rules.

## React

- **Component Names**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `MyComponent`).
- **File Naming**: Use the same name for the component file as the component itself.
- **Props**: Destructure props in the function signature unless there's a good reason not to.
- **JSX Formatting**: Format JSX with proper indentation and line breaks for readability.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Use ternary operators or short-circuiting for simple conditions in JSX.
- **Component Organization**: Group related components in folders when they have multiple files (e.g., `MyComponent/MyComponent.tsx`).

## TypeScript

- **Type Annotations**: Utilize TypeScript's static typing features extensively.
- **Interfaces and Types**: Use interfaces for objects and types for other situations like unions, intersections, and aliases.
- **Type Inference**: Rely on TypeScript's type inference as much as possible.
- **Enums**: Use enums for fixed sets of related constants.
- **Generics**: Use generics to write reusable and type-safe functions and components.

## Prisma

- **Database Models**: Use descriptive names for Prisma models and fields.
- **Queries and Mutations**: Name queries and mutations clearly based on their actions and the entities involved.
- **Type Safety**: Utilize Prisma's generated type-safe queries to prevent runtime errors.

## NextAuth.js

- **Authentication Hooks**: Use the provided hooks by NextAuth.js for authentication in your components.
- **Session Management**: Clearly handle session and user data using NextAuth.js APIs.
- **Custom Providers**: If using custom authentication providers, follow NextAuth.js guidelines for implementation.

## Linting and Formatting

We use linting tools to enforce our coding style guidelines. Run `npm run lint` to check for any violations.

## Continuous Improvement

These guidelines are meant to evolve over time. Feel free to suggest improvements by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.
